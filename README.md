#  Flight Booking System – Assignment

This repository contains my solution for a Flight Booking System backend project, built with **Spring Boot 3**, **Java 17**, and **MongoDB (Reactive)**.

The goal is to design a small airline booking platform, model the data entities, expose REST APIs, and validate key business rules with unit and integration tests.

##  Features Implemented
- **Airline inventory management** (add, list airlines)
- **Flight booking workflow** (one-way and round-trip pricing, seat validation, PNR generation)
- **Passenger and seat management** linked to bookings
- **Ticket retrieval and booking history**
- **Global exception handling** for validation errors
- **Unit tests** with JUnit 5, Mockito, and WebTestClient
- **Load testing with JMeter** (performance summary reports)
- **Code quality analysis with SonarQube** (coverage, bugs, maintainability)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Spring Boot WebFlux (Reactive APIs)
- MongoDB with ReactiveMongoTemplate
- Jakarta Validation
- JUnit 5 + Mockito + WebTestClient
- Apache JMeter (performance/load testing)
- SonarQube (static analysis and code quality)
